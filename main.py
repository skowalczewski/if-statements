Complete this grade checker program using only:
- Variables

# Use 'or' to check if grade is less than 0 OR greater than 100
# If the grade is invalid, print an error message
# Example: if grade < 0 or grade > 100:

# YOUR CODE HERE


# TODO 2: Check for grade A (90 and above)
# Use >= to check if grade is 90 or higher
# If true, print "Your letter grade is: A"

# YOUR CODE HERE


# TODO 3: Check for grade B (80 to 89) 
# Use >= to check if grade is 80 or higher
# If true, print "Your letter grade is: B"

# YOUR CODE HERE


# TODO 4: Check for grade C (70 to 79)
# Use >= to check if grade is 70 or higher  
# If true, print "Your letter grade is: C"

# YOUR CODE HERE


# TODO 5: Check for grade D (60 to 69)
# Use >= to check if grade is 60 or higher
# If true, print "Your letter grade is: D"

# YOUR CODE HERE


# TODO 6: Handle grade F (below 60)
# Use else to handle any remaining grades
# Print "Your letter grade is: F"
